Overall look must be industrial, clean, premium, and trustworthy

Color theme strictly:

Primary: Industrial Orange

Secondary: Dark Blue / Navy / Bluish tone

Background: White or very light grey

❌ Do NOT use purple, pink, red gradients, or flashy colors

Use soft shadows, rounded cards, clean typography, good spacing
